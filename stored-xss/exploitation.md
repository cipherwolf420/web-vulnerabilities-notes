# Exploitation and Impact Validation for Stored XSS

This phase validates whether the previously identified stored input,
when rendered in the confirmed HTML body context, can lead to
**arbitrary JavaScript execution** in a victim’s browser.

The goal is not payload complexity, but **execution confirmation and impact assessment**.

---

## Objective

- Confirm executable injection at the rendering point
- Demonstrate browser-side JavaScript execution
- Validate that execution occurs for users other than the submitter
- Assess realistic security impact

---

## Payload Selection Strategy

Based on prior analysis:

- Stored input is rendered in an HTML body context
- No consistent output encoding is applied at render time
- No attribute or JavaScript string boundaries are present

Given these conditions, a simple and deterministic payload was selected
to confirm execution without relying on browser quirks or user interaction.

---

## Execution Proof

The following payload was used to validate execution:

```html
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>

This payload was chosen because:

<script> is valid in an HTML body context

It executes immediately upon rendering

It provides a clear, non-destructive execution indicator

It confirms execution within the application’s origin

Execution Observation

Upon rendering the stored content:

The JavaScript payload executed successfully

The alert dialog displayed the application’s domain

Execution occurred without additional user interaction

The behavior was reproducible across page reloads

This confirms that attacker-supplied JavaScript is executed
by the browser at render time.

Victim Scope Validation

Execution was observed when the stored content was viewed by:

Other authenticated users

Accounts distinct from the original submitter

This confirms that the issue is not self-XSS and affects multiple users.

Depending on where the stored content is rendered,
administrative or privileged users may also be impacted.

Impact Analysis

Successful exploitation of this stored XSS vulnerability enables:

Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in victim sessions

Session token theft (if cookies are accessible via JavaScript)

Account takeover through authenticated request execution

CSRF chaining and client-side request forgery

Phishing and UI redressing attacks

Exfiltration of sensitive user data

Because execution occurs persistently and impacts multiple users,
the severity of this issue is higher than reflected XSS.

Outcome

The application allows user-controlled data to be stored and later rendered
in an executable HTML context without sufficient output encoding.

This results in a confirmed stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
with significant impact potential.
