# Vulnerability Chaining – Testing Notes

This folder documents attack chains where multiple vulnerabilities
are combined to achieve higher impact.

These scenarios reflect how real-world attackers abuse
otherwise medium-severity issues.

---

## What This Covers

- How individual vulnerabilities interact
- How impact increases through chaining
- How attackers pivot from one issue to another

---

## Available Chains

- XSS → CSRF  
  Using JavaScript execution to bypass CSRF protections
  and perform authenticated actions.
