# Web Vulnerabilities – Research & Testing Notes

This repository contains my practical testing notes for identifying,
analyzing, and validating common web application vulnerabilities.

The focus is on:
- How vulnerabilities are discovered during real testing
- How context is analyzed before exploitation
- Why specific payloads work
- How impact is assessed
- How vulnerabilities can be chained for higher impact

## Covered Vulnerabilities
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## Advanced Topics
- Vulnerability Chaining (XSS → CSRF, etc.)

Each folder contains step-by-step analysis notes written from a
tester / bug hunter perspective.
