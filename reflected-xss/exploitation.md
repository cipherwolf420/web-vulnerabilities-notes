## Exploitation and Impact Assessment

Using the previously identified injection point and payload strategy, arbitrary
JavaScript execution was successfully achieved in the victim’s browser.

The following payload was used to confirm execution:

```html
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
```

The payload executed as expected, demonstrating that attacker-supplied
JavaScript is processed and executed by the browser in the context of the
target application.

## Impact Analysis

Successful exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
JavaScript in the context of a victim user. Depending on the application’s
authentication and session handling mechanisms, this can lead to:

- Session token theft (if cookies are accessible via JavaScript)
- Account takeover through authenticated request execution
- Client-side request forgery and CSRF chaining
- Phishing and UI redressing attacks
- Exfiltration of sensitive user data

The severity of this issue is amplified if the affected endpoint is accessible
to authenticated users or privileged roles.
